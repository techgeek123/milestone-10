## Release 0 : What's an e-commerce website?
[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce) says
> E-commerce is the activity of buying or selling online. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.

## Release 1 : Most common e-commerce sites
[Amazon](http://amazon.com), [eBay](http://ebay.com) and [TaoBao](https://world.taobao.com) are some of the popular sites across the world.
[Flipkart](https://flipkart.com), [Amazon](https://amazon.in) and [Paytm](https://paytm.com) are popular in India.

Go through these websites and observe the features they have. Try to list out the advantages and shortcomings of each of the website.
Think about the flow
- The user interaction
- The seller interaction (Most of the ecommerce websites are market places for sellers)
- The data flow
- Externel services connected: examples could be sms, email, payment gateway etc

## Release 2 : Features list
For an e-commerce site, UX can be correlated with the traffic which is a direct parameter for generating revenue. But at the same time, there could be lot of traffic which needs to be handled by your backend infrastructure. Every minute detail matters when you are building a site for a million users.

Answer these questions
- What are my constraints?
- What am I solving for?
- How do I optimize the performace?
- How do I create the best user interaction?
- What's catching your eye in the homepage

Go and interact with people who might be working / have worked intensively in the domain. You could be having a team who is building sellers platform for ecommerce working at fifteen feet away from you, you never know.

Now build a clear and detailed features list for your application using trello.

## Release 3 : Project work flow and testing
Write tests, period.


## Release 3 : Version-ing 
It is compulsory for this MileStone to make versions and use Trello. Your webapp needs to be divided into various versions with appropriate features. Do not start coding till you have done this. Take some time and create the 0.1,0.2, MVP etc. 

Divide the work between you and your pair. How will you merge the FE and the BE once you're done? You should ideally have goals set in your versions where you can sync up your code and test that everything is working fine. 

Breaking up the app will help you do this smoothly. 

Also use Git branching and merging. It's a good opportunity to test your knowledge of git workflow and get some hands on experience with advanced git working.
